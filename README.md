✨ Modern Flutter UI Showcase

A beautifully designed Flutter UI project inspired by a Behance concept, created to explore and demonstrate advanced Flutter techniques, including animations, layouts, and modern app interactions.
This project focuses on bringing a designer’s vision to life using Flutter’s powerful widget system and animation capabilities, showcasing my skills in responsive design, state management, and clean UI architecture.

🎯 Project Goals

Recreate a modern, production-quality app interface from a Behance design.
Practice smooth animations (implicit & explicit) and hero transitions.
Experiment with responsive layouts, adaptive design, and custom widgets.
Showcase clean, maintainable code suitable for real-world Flutter projects.

🧠 Learning Focus

This project is part of my personal Flutter portfolio, created to push my understanding of UI/UX implementation and bridge the gap between design and development. It’s an ongoing exploration of what’s possible with Flutter in terms of motion, polish, and user experience.
